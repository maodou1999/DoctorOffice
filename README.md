# DoctorOffice

Implemented a MVC Website for Doctor Office using Entity Framework 5 and MVC5 for secure communication between doctors and patients
  1. Manage patient accounts
  2. Manage message between doctors and patients
  3. Upload patient documents such as blood test results, etc.
  4. Security is a big part of this project as all the data transmission must go through secure channel
  5. Send email notice to  patients when message/documents are added to them so that they can log on the web site to read detailed information
